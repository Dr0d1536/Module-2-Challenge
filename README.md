ReadMe - MultiYear Stock

Purpose:
The purpose of this activity was to present the performance results of several thousand stocks. I organized the three years of data into four sections to help interpret the data - "Ticker," "Yearly Change," "Percent Chance," and "Total Stock Volume."

As a bonus, I also included additional details for stock which stood out, "Greatest % Increase," "Greatest % Decrease," and "Greatest Total Volume" for each year. 

The data I've compiled allows the viewer to make more informed decisions in a fraction of the time. 

Analysis:
Over the three years of data collected, it demonstrated a Beta-Value higher than 1.0. In addition, the increased volatility in the collected data supports the high Beta level hypothesis. An example of this is the WSF stock. WSF had the most significant increase in 2018, but it was down over 20% in the following years. LVR held to its downward freefall of over 96% or greater over the recorded period.  
 
Results:
More data would have to be collected to understand better the volatility expressed in the data. The data does provide an excellent job presenting the highs and lows and volumes of each stock - but it couldn't be used to make any sound financial decisions.
